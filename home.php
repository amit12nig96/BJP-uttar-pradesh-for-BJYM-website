            <span id="ContentPlaceHolder1_lblHome"><strong>Shri Subrat Pathak</strong>, Candidate of 15th Lok Sabha, Affiliated to Bharatiya Janata Party serving Kannauj (UP) Lok Sabha Constituency.<br />
<br />
The BJP's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, formed in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After the State of Emergency in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party; it defeated the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election. After three years in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. Although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the 1984 general election, it grew in strength on the back of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government lasted only 13 days.<br />
<br />
After the 1998 general election, the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) formed a government under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for a year. Following fresh elections, the NDA government, again headed by Vajpayee, lasted for a full term in office; this was the first non-Congress government to do so. In the 2004 general election, the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party. Long time Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi led it to a landslide victory in the 2014 general election. Since that election, Modi leads the NDA government as Prime Minister and as of August 2016, the alliance governs 15 states.<br />

Son of <strong>Om Prkash</strong>, The BJP leader claims he “inherited” the “nationalist ideology” from his father, Om Prakash Pathak, who himself was associated with the RSS. Om Prakash is currently the president of Kannauj’s ‘Attar and Perfumers Association’ and runs the ancestral business of manufacturing perfume started by his grandfather in 1911. Subrat’s mother Saroj Pathak is currently the chairman of Kannauj Nagar Palika.<strong>&ldquo;Om Prakash&rdquo;</strong> .</span>
